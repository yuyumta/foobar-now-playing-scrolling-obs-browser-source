# setup
1. make a folder anywhere containing the html file
2. go to install the now playing foobar plugin (credits to whoever made that (not me))
3. make the plugin output to the folder you created earlier. im not sure what the limits here are, but multiple lines should be fine
4. add the html file as a browser source in obs
5. optionally, you can add album art as well by using flowin and adding a window containing the album art, then simply doing window captur

theres some config options in the html file somewhere, for the amount of characters before it starts scrolling, and font, and probably something else too
